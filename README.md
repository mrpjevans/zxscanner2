# zxscanner2
An updated scanning script for reading the ZX Spectrum keyboard

UPDATE 14/12/19: A first version of the script is now available. This will be updated frequently as I improve it and more documentation will be added.

Which is late! Sorry! Due to some family matters I've been unable to get this fully ready by time of publication. HOWEVER, I will be publishing the code and more detail about this project shortly. Please subscribe to updates or contact me on pj@mrpjevans.com and I'll update you when everything is ready.

Thank you for you interest!
