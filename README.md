# zxscanner2
An updated scanning script for reading the ZX Spectrum keyboard

Which is late! Sorry! Due to some family matters I've been unable to get this fully ready by time of publication. HOWEVER, I will be publishing the code and more detail about this project shortly. Please subscribe to updates or contact me on pj@mrpjevans.com and I'll update you when everything is ready.

Thank you for you interest!
